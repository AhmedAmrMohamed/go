Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. This c++ program allows two players to play the game nut the tricky part is that it rejects all the illegal moves and automatically enforce most of it's rules (which can be sort of complicated). 

features:
-Can detect and prevent self capture.
-Can detect when an enemy stone(s) should be removed from the board.
-detect and reject all invalid entries like trying to play outside the board,playing on a busy stone,...etc;
-when both the players PASS on successive turns points for both players are calculated correctly and the winner is determined.
-can save and load your last saved game at any points.
upcoming features:
- so far i am trying to implement a function that can detect and prevent KO state(I already have one i'm just trying to make way more efficient)
Notes:
i started programming for almost a year (at the time this lines were written) and it was only competitive programming so far. So this is the first project i code that's to be used by humans.
this is not a commercial product it was mainly created for educational reasons.
It probably doesn't have any potential or maybe it does,who knows?
